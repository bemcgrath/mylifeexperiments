# About Me

Hi, I'm Brian McGrath - a husband, dad, lifelong runner, and technology enthusiast who believes in the power of small, intentional changes to transform our lives.

For over 25 years, running has been my constant companion, taking me through college, career transitions, parenthood, and now into middle age. I've logged miles on beaches in South Carolina (where I call home), and in cities across the globe - from Sydney to Shanghai, Paris to London, and many places in between.

But my real journey of transformation began when I hit a frustrating roadblock with recurring injuries. At 185 pounds on my 5'9" frame, I realized I couldn't simply outrun a poor diet. This epiphany led me to approach health and wellness like an experiment, taking small, sustainable steps toward better habits.

## My Approach

I believe in the power of curiosity and experimentation. Rather than diving into drastic changes, I focus on making incremental improvements - what I call "habit stacking." Each month becomes a new experiment, building upon previous successes while maintaining a sustainable, long-term perspective.

My philosophy is simple:
- Start small and stay consistent
- Treat changes as experiments rather than obligations
- Focus on sustainable lifestyle shifts, not quick fixes
- Use data and measurement to guide progress
- Share experiences to help others on their journey

## What I Write About

Through my blog, I share honest accounts of my monthly experiments in health, fitness, and personal growth. From reducing sugar intake to exploring the science of carbohydrates, I document both the challenges and victories of these lifestyle changes, backed by data from tools like continuous glucose monitors and supported by current research.

## Beyond Running

When I'm not running or writing, I'm a technology professional who loves diving deep into data and finding practical applications for new tools and technologies. I'm also a dedicated family man who believes that taking care of our health is one of the most important ways we can show love for our families.

## Let's Connect

I'm sharing my journey not because I have all the answers, but because I believe in the power of community and shared experiences. Whether you're a runner, a parent trying to make healthier choices, or someone just starting their wellness journey, I'd love to hear from you.

Remember: You don't need to make dramatic changes to see real results. Sometimes, the smallest experiments can lead to the biggest transformations.

*"Start today. Make a change. You just need to take a small step and don't overthink it."*
